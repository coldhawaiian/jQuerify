#jQuerify#

A pretty simple userscript for Chrome, Firefox, and more that injects jQuery into every page which doesn't have it already. 

Basically, just install this to Greasemonkey or just open the script in Chrome, and the latest jQuery 1.x release will be added to all pages so you can always pop open a console and expect jQuery support.
